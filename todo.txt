INTERESTING:: SHOULD SWITCH TO USING THIS AFTER OTHER CHANGES:
https://developers.google.com/blockly/installation/js-interpreter

HTML
	1. when run button make it like SNAP! or SCRATCH! run start block (not wrapper just at top)
	3. make all messages (in run blockly and console.log and server) dependent on Blockly.messages (so easily translatable)
	2. getRidOfNakedCode is probably poorly created
	4. potentially add google chrome extension server && offline web client app (integrated with server?)
	
SERVER
	0. server needs to disconnect from sphero when disconnected from web client
		(consistently, sometimes does sometimes doesn't)
	
	For example, some ideas about additional features:
	- Local installation of the web application (avoid problems due to network latency or unavailabilities)
	- Support of more than one Sphero to illustrate the collaboration between robots
	- Support calibration
	- Optimize the feature used to save and to open existing projects
	- Etc.
